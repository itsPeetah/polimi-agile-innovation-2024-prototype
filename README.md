# Agile Innovation (2024) Prototype - Zaini Milano (Group 4)

## About the repo

This repository contains the source code for the prototype developed by **Group 4** ("_NotJustaTeam_") as part of the _Agile Innovation_ course at Politecnico di Milano.

### Project Overview

Our project aimed to enhance the phygital retail experience of Zàini Milano, the coffee shop boutique branch of the renowned chocolate factory Zàini Spa. Utilizing agile innovation techniques, particularly the design sprint methodology, we conceptualized and developed an interactive in-store experience.

### Prototype Description

The solution we created is a multi-branch, user-choice-driven interactive video, inspired by Netflix's Bandersnatch. This prototype allows customers to engage with the store environment in an immersive and interactive manner, making choices that influence their journey through the experience.

## Technical information

The prototype was developed as a NextJS app.

- [Version 1](https://github.com/itsPeetah/polimi-agile-innovation-2024-prototype/tree/version-1) just replaced the `src` attribute of a video element per choice. The solution worked for what we needed, but could be improved by preloading all videos
- [Current Version](https://github.com/itsPeetah/polimi-agile-innovation-2024-prototype/tree/main)'s code is a little janky because it was quickly arranged the day before the final presentation. I decided to preload the videos, causing an initial waiting time but guaranteeing a seamless experience even through multiple executions
